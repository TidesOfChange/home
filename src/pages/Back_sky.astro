  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Both feared and hallowed amongst the residents of Aeolian Archipelago, the name “Skycaller” invokes omens of both awe and terror. Skycallers are exceptionally rare weather shamans capable of taming the storms that ravage the Archipelago, and are both feared and respected amongst all. Relentlessly hunted by FLOoN for their valuable and dangerous powers, Skycallers are forced to live in secret, with many opting to join Cloudrunner cells for protection. Skycallers are key assets to Cloudrunner cells, who would surely perish navigating the raging tempests of the Archipelago otherwise. Due to their innate connection to the environment, Skycallers are greatly affected both physically and mentally by pollution, which is why many Skycallers choose to fight against the megapolluting FLOoN. It is unknown how Skycallers came to be or how they’ve learned to channel the energy of crystals, but many Skycallers revere Veltharion the Tidebinder, the legendary first Skycaller, as the source of their powers.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Skills and Customization</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Skycallers live on the edge, quite literally all of the time. They are careful of who they interact with and trust, and can be difficult to get along and communicate with. Skycallers have found their strengths in matters of Reaction, Affinity, Deception, Fear, & Awareness from this lifestyle. They possess a special skill: Forecasting (Intuition). Skycallers have the unique ability to be one with the weather. They can predict it, react to it, observe it in forethought, and in some dire cases, even control it. A typical skycaller will not have an enlarged array of equipment on them, as all they require is their pendant to display their skycaller branding, a wooden staff with runic carvings, and a compass that can be used up to twice a day in order to gain advantage in an Awareness check. Being moreover hermits, it is rare for a Skycaller to be seen talking within a public space, however there have been cases where Skycallers get along with friends who know of their identity, previous mentors, cloudrunners they hold close to them, and even some members of FLOoN, though only the most sympathetic.
