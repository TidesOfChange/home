      GMs will decide how much XP characters earn after each session based on what the characters accomplish. Ideally, characters should be able to gain at least some XP almost every session (at least at the beginning, while costs are low), but should not be able to do too much leveling between sessions. A threshold of 10–20XP might make sense based on the types of encounters players have in a session.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Increasing skills and attributes should not happen arbitrarily. They should reflect the experiences the character has. If you want a rank 2 in Strength, but don't do anything in game play that could feasibly improve that strength score, it shouldn't be leveled up. Conversely, if you're doing a lot of hacking, you're probably getting better at it, and you might choose to level up your cybernetics skill over time.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-8">
      No single thing from the session itself may be leveled up more than once per session and must be done by the end of the session.

      Once players start gaining XP for characters, they can invest it in specific stats or abilities:

    <ul class="list-inside mb-4 space-y-10">
      <li>
        <strong>Health:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-10 space-y-2">
          <li>Each character starts with 10 + rank in Health hit points. To increase hi
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Example:</strong> A character with a rank 3 in health would spend
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Attributes:</strong> 
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-10 space-y-2">
          <li>To level up an attribute, multiply the new rank x 10 in XP
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Example:</strong> Leveling up Magic from 3 to 4 would cost 40XP
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Skills:</strong> 
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-10 space-y-2">
          <li>To level up an existing skill, multiply the new rank x 5 in XP
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Example:</strong> Leveling up Force from a 2 to 3 costs 15XP
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>New Skills:</strong> 
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-10 space-y-2">
          <li>Allocating XP to a skill the player is not proficient in and has no 
            ranks in costs 10XP to acquire the first level, instead of 5, and should 
            narratively make sense based on types of things the character has done. 
            Once the new skill is acquired, additional leveling costs the same as 
            existing skills.
          </li>

      </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Expertise:</strong>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-10 space-y-2">
            <li>The first expertise in a background tree is free at character creation. Leveling in the Expertise tree, however, costs XP. The top row of the tree (level 1) costs 10XP each to acquire.</li>
            <li>The second row (level 2) costs 20XP.</li>
            <li>The third row (level 3) costs 30XP.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Note:</strong> The progression through the tree also needs to be sequential (you cannot jump from level 1 to level 3 in an expertise). The unique starting background expertise is in the top left corner of this tree. The first level in the second column expertise also needs to be purchased before the first level in the third column expertise. But higher levels do not need to follow the same column progression so long as level one is acquired.

              <strong>Example:</strong>
              <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded-md">
