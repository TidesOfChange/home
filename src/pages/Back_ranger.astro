  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    he ranger grew up in a close knit village that valued community over anything. The rangerâ€™s father was an explorer and the mother was a warrior. As a small child, the ranger 
    lost their pet family of frogs to seagulls. Devastated by the loss of their beloved pets, the ranger vowed to devote their life to protection of their loved ones and their 
    surroundings. Being raised by an explorer and a warrior, the ranger is able to survey the nearby area and assess any danger. When faced with danger, they can fend for themselves 
    in a pinch but are not as strong as a full on warrior class character. The ranger loves to explore nature in their free time. Defining Traits: Good at adapting, Good Observation, 
    Strategic thinker, Physical Endurance. Disadvantages: Isolated for many hours, Emotionally detached, Fear of commitment . Middle ground between a fighter and a scout. Focused on 
    exploration of nearby lands, as well as the patrol of their own lands. For Aqualumeans, they patrol the power source deposits and reservoir. Can fend for themselves in a pinch, 
    but tend to call for help sooner than later. Motivated by the idea of being the hero to those the Ranger loves
