  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Cloudrunners are criminals. Although some may have noble intentions or lofty goals, the life of a Cloudrunner is characterized by violent conflict, constant danger, and a 
    struggle for survival. Most law-abiding citizens try to keep their head down and avoid Cloudrunners at all costs, lest they become collateral damage in the fighting. Enterprising 
    local businesses may enlist the help of Cloudrunners for a variety of reasons—bodyguards/protection, disrupting corporate actions, smuggling money or goods, or any activities 
    that they might want to keep hidden from Frontier and its subsidiaries. These contracts are the main source of income for most Cloudrunners, highly prized and contested among 
    rival Cloudrunner “cells” (factions). Reputation is everything, and the “rules” of Cloudrunner society are mostly self-enforcing. Nobody wants to hire someone who has sold out 
    their contractor to the corporation, gone back on their promises, or repeatedly failed to complete their tasks, and so less reliable Cloudrunners tend to be kicked out of groups 
    and are left behind. Likewise, contractors rarely dare to deal in bad faith with Cloudrunners because they know that they could just as easily be the Cloudrunners’ next target.

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Cloudrunners need to be able to adapt and survive in a chaos-fueled environment on a daily basis. Because of their lifestyles, Cloudrunners have become prevalent in 
    skills of Mechanics, Vehicles, Thievery, Sneakiness & Force. They also pose a unique skill to only their culture: Flying (Agility). Cloudrunners’ ability to fly through use 
    of their equipment allows for members to be able to navigate through the airways, by means of both transportation and conflict. The typical Cloudrunner has been seen to hold an 
    array of wooden weapons (each doing 2 harm), a cloudrunning kite for matters of flight, and a forging kit that aids in their prevalent needs of creating false IDs and other 
    critical documents. Cloudrunners also have the ability to communicate with cohorts who may not seem so friendly. As with their nature, Cloudrunners have been seen dealing with 
    leaders of regional cells, corporation contacts, and other bosses from their previous work.
