    <!-- Title -->
    <h1 class="text-7xl font-bold">Magic</h1>
    
    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>Some characters have learned how to draw energy from surrounding natural forces in order to power simple magical effects.</p>
    <p>Spells must be learned and mastered through practice and concentration. The amount of spells a character knows is equal to their rank in their Magic attribute -1. So if a character has a 3 in Magic, they know 2 spells. If they spend XP to increase their magic to a 4, they can learn one new spell. Certain abilities and expertises may grant additional spells that are separate from this total.</p>

    <!-- Caution Box -->
    <div class="bg-yellow-700 p-4 rounded-md">
      <strong>⚠ Caution</strong>
      <p>Characters cannot change the spells they know. Once they’ve learned a spell, they always know that spell (though they may become unable to draw on the energy that powers it due to various effects).</p>
    </div>

    <p>Only one spell may be cast by a character at a time – <strong>spells cannot be stacked.</strong> The amount of focus and concentration, however, is mentally exhausting. And so each known spell can be cast no more than twice per day before the character will need to rest. After a full period of sleep, all spells are regained.</p>

    <!-- Spell Categories -->
