  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Once the earth was beginning to show serious signs of decline, Farmers were looking for some sort of paradise that they thought they could help rebuild the wrecked world around them. 
    But once they were kicked out from the Seed Vault their role became even more important. The last generation of Farmers that actually worked with the seeds in the Seed Vault weren’t 
    capable of fighting and thought that their skill set was better put towards helping their communities. They do a little bit of everything to help out and make their communities better, 
    whether that be building new homes, making repairs, or farming to ensure everyone has enough food. In their community coalitions, they patrol to make sure the people are safe from 
    threats by Frontier. </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    There isn’t one set group of people that would make someone a right candidate for this role but it typically lends itself to those who love nature like gardeners and helping those who 
    like to help others as this role is one that tends to give more than it receives. It is also good for those who want to be a part of the action but want to be able to take a more laid 
    back approach.

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-1">
    <li>1-Medicine: To help heal the plants and possibly other players. 
        2-Foraging: They know what plants are helpful to eat, which ones to avoid and which ones can help aid others. 
        3-Reaction: They can fight but their fighting isn’t that of a skilled fighter. 
        4-Sneakiness: They have been working with the seeds and plants for so long that their sense of hearing is on point. 
        5-Deduction: They are highly intelligent due to them working with the seeds and plants for so long but also for the way that they are able to pass down stories. </li>
    <li>Unique skill: Revive - The ability to bring plants back to life.</li>
    <li>The three pieces of gear/equipment that the Farmers have are a canteen of water, a satchel and a mysterious jar of white gel. 
        The canteen is for water so that they can water seeds and people, the satchel is to carry both the canteen and gel but to also carry seeds and the gel is an ointment 
        base that they can transform into medicine that might be needed.</li>
    <li>NPC Connection: The Farmers all know Ernest Elderberry one of the village elders and they can go to him for help or information </li>
  </ul>
