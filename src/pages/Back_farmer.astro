  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Once the earth began to decline, Farmers searched for a paradise to help rebuild the wrecked world.
    After being expelled from the Seed Vault, their importance grew. The final generation that worked there weren't fighters—they became supporters of their communities, helping with construction, farming, and protection.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    This role fits those who love nature, enjoy helping others, and prefer a supportive role in the action. They do a bit of everything, often giving more than receiving.

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-1">
    <li>1-Medicine: To help heal the plants and possibly other players. 
        2-Foraging: They know what plants are helpful to eat, which ones to avoid and which ones can help aid others. 
        3-Reaction: They can fight but their fighting isn’t that of a skilled fighter. 
        4-Sneakiness: They have been working with the seeds and plants for so long that their sense of hearing is on point. 
        5-Deduction: They are highly intelligent due to them working with the seeds and plants for so long but also for the way that they are able to pass down stories. </li>
    <li>Unique skill: Revive - The ability to bring plants back to life.</li>
    <li>The three pieces of gear/equipment that the Farmers have are a canteen of water, a satchel and a mysterious jar of white gel. 
        The canteen is for water so that they can water seeds and people, the satchel is to carry both the canteen and gel but to also carry seeds and the gel is an ointment 
        base that they can transform into medicine that might be needed.</li>
    <li>NPC Connection: The Farmers all know Ernest Elderberry one of the village elders and they can go to him for help or information </li>
  </ul>
