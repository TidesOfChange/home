  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Enchanters find their way into magic through a mysterious and ephemeral book that seems to manifest around people who are especially attuned to crystal energy. This book is 
    called The Enchanter’s Code. Upon initial opening, however, it appears to be only a container in which a Defender’s Ring is stored. On the inside cover is written: “Put the ring 
    on your left pinky finger and open the book again.” Upon doing so, The Enchanter’s Code transforms into a full book written in a complex and archaic language. With dedicated study, 
    however, Enchanters learn to channel various magical effects through the Defender’s Ring. While not nearly as adept as specially trained Spiritual Resonators, Enchanters are able to 
    use their intuition to tap into the energy of crystals in specific ways. Defining traits: Hard working, Curious, Good attention to detail, Intellectual. Disadvantages: Fear of Failure, 
    Stubborn, Arrogant about magic. Focus in protection by magic. Shields, barriers, walls. Due to proximity to a powerful crystal source, Aqualumeans have an abundance of Enchanters 
    within their kind. They are utilized to conceal as well as protect Lumea.They are able to use magic through the use of a Defender’s Ring. Without the Defender’s Ring, they have trouble 
    accessing their magic powers. Motivated by being able to successfully avoid conflict
