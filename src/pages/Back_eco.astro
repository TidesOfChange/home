  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Sustainable engineers that harness the potential of synergizing technology with nature. Ecotechnics as a discipline traces its origin to the late stages of pre-apocalyptic Earth 
    when people began to realize that reliance on technology or the natural environment in isolation would not be enough for their survival. Instead, ecotechnicians dedicate their 
    lives to discovering and perfecting techniques to make creations that are inspired by and leverage the strengths of natural phenomena. Their unique approach to innovation unlocks 
    the full potential of engineering while still existing in harmony with nature. When tasked with building settlements, Ecotechnicians make structures that incorporate insights from 
    plants that root them strongly in the ground and promote the recycling of resources in its environment. For communications and computing systems, they draw inspiration from mushrooms 
    and their intricate mycelium networks to build connections with unparalleled speed and coordination. Overall, ecotechnicians are well-versed in both mechanical and natural knowledge, 
    giving them a uniquely solid awareness of almost any type of surroundings. Due to their frequent use of tools and heavy materials this has led to Ecotechnicians becoming rather strong 
    people.
