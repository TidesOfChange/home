  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Seed Keepers are a group of scholars that take care of the seeds in the Seed Vault. They are responsible for cataloging, studying, and protecting the seeds. They have deep knowledge 
    of plant species. Seed Keepers catalog every seed, maintaining a database that contains each species. Seed Keepers also have a strong understanding of the Seed Vault’s security and 
    technology. After the Seed Vault was taken over by Frontier and they were fired from their jobs, Seed Keepers were in charge of documenting their life’s work of successful farming 
    practices and healing powers. In the new villages, they also serve as doctors and nurses for both patients and plants. 
</p>

<p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">Seed Keepers possess five skills that enable them to serve as protectors of the seeds. With a foundation in Leadership, they can effectively organize their 
    community, using their persuasive abilities to earn trust. Their Force skill helps with their physical strength and capability in hand-to-hand combat, allowing them to protect the seed
     vault and carry the fights that require physical resilience. Skilled in Bartering, Seed Keepers are good at making trades, they often get good deals. Their sharp Insight gives them 
     the ability to read people and situations. Additionally, their Sneakiness skill enables them to move undetected, allowing them to protect valuable seeds and navigate sensitive areas 
     without drawing attention.</p>

<p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">The Seed Keepers have one unique skill - PlantSpeak. The Seed Keepers can connect deeply with the natural energy of the world, sensing the health and 
    stability of surrounding plants. The Seed Keepers can create a temporary protective barrier around seeds or plants, protecting them from environmental hazards or physical threats. 
    The shield preserves the vitality of the seeds.</p>

<p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">Seed Keepers have three main pieces of equipment. A data tablet, which is a device that the Seed Keepers secretly keep that contains information about 
    the seed vault’s species and storage methods. A portable seed kit that contains a sample of the most rare seed. They also have an old key that used to work for accessing the seed 
    vault and secured areas</p>
